# CLI Toolchain for the Flou Programming Language 

Flou is intended as a Rust dialect and tries to make the ownership more accessable and easier to work with.
It overhauls rusts syntax in order to allow for faster writing and to remove visual noise (like semikolons).
The language itself is not complete and will be worked on further in the future. To get a better grasp of its
philosophy view "docs/philosophy".
