OPERATORS


Operators are essential in programming languages. They are the building blocks for any larger operation.
In Thyn they combine two, less or more identifiers and act one them. These are all operators one by one.
The operators with the highest binding power come first, then it
lower until it reaches its final destination: the equation operator:


Application:
    a(b)        Calling
    a[b]        Indexing

Prefix Unary Operators:                         | overloadable
    !a          Invertion (bitwise & logical)
    -> a        Referencing
    -a          Negation
    +a          Double Negation

Postfix Unary Mutations:                        | overloadable
    a++         Incrementation
    a--         Decrementation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\_ Operating on only one value

Types:
    a b        Typing identifiers

Pipe Operator:

    1. a <| b

    2. a |> b   Piping
                note: The precendence can be ignored while writing patterns.

Mathematical/Binary Operators:                  | overloadable

    1. User Defined Operators get defaulted here, for instance: Â· (dot), >< (cross-product)

    2. a * b    Multiplication
       a / b    Division
       a % b    Euclidic Modulo: -10 % 3 = 2;
                                 10 % -3 = -2
    3. a + b    Addition
       a - b    Subtraction

    4. a & b    Bitwise AND
       a | b    Bitwise OR
       a >| b   Bitwise XOR

Comparison Operators (can be chained):

    1. a == b   Equality

    2. a < b    Smaller
       a > b    Greater
       a <= b   Smaller or Equal
       a >= b   Greater of Equal

    3. a != b   Inequality (America)

Logical Operators (lazy):
    a || b      Or
    a !|| b     Nor
    a && b      And
    a !&& b     Nand

Comma Operator:
    a, b        Combining values into a list.

Mutations:                                      | overloadable
    a := b      Writing

    a *= b      Multiplication-Assign
    a /= b      Division-Assign
    a %= b      Modulo-Assign

    a += b      Addition-Assign
    a -= b      Subtraction-Assign

    a &= b      Bitwise AND-Assign
    a |= b      Bitwise OR-Assign
    a >|= b     Bitwise XOR-Assign

    a =|= b     Swapping

Equation Operator:
    a = b       Definition
